Project Title: IrisClassifier - Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

Project Overview:

IrisClassifier is a machine learning-based system that classifies iris flowers into different species based on their physical characteristics. The system uses supervised learning techniques to analyze iris data and predict the corresponding species.

Methodology:

1. Data Collection: Gather the Iris dataset (e.g., Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, Iris virginica)
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and normalize data for training
3. Model Development: Train a machine learning model using techniques like:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Trees
    - Random Forest
    - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
4. Model Evaluation: Validate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
5. Deployment: Deploy the model as a web or desktop application for iris classification

Key Features:

1. Species Prediction: Predict the iris species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on input characteristics
2. Characteristic Input: Input iris characteristics (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)
3. Confidence Level: Provide a confidence level for the predicted species
4. Visualization: Visualize the predicted species and input characteristics

Machine Learning Techniques:

1. Logistic Regression: For binary classification
2. Decision Trees: For decision-making and feature selection
3. Random Forest: For ensemble learning and improved accuracy
4. Support Vector Machines (SVM): For kernel-based classification
